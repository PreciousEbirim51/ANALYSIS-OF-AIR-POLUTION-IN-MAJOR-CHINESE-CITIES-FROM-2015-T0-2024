INTRODUCTION

Air pollution has been one of China’s most pressing environmental challenges over the past decade. Rapid industrialization, urbanization, and energy consumption particularly from coal led to severe air quality issues, especially in major metropolitan areas. However, stringent government policies, technological advancements, and shifts toward cleaner energy have resulted in notable improvements since 2015.

This analysis examines the trends and impacts of air pollution in China’s key cities from 2015 to 2024, focusing on critical pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, AQI and O₃. It explores the regional disparities in air quality, and emerging challenges like rising ozone levels.

DATA CLEANING

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and some precautions were taken even though the dataset was clean. Some of these precautions taken were;

Ensuring absence of empty rows.
Ensuring absence of duplicated rows.
Ensuring the date entries are standardized to a uniform date format.
STANDARD EXCEL TABLE: The dataset was transformed to a standard excel table for easier management and automation.

PRE-ANALYSIS

Pre-Analysis Board
I conducted a pre-analysis process on the dataset before analyzing the dataset on pivot chart. This pre-analysis involves breaking the dataset into meaningful components.

Project Split: The dataset was split into two variables which are independent and dependent variables and this helps in understanding the relationship between the data points and can provide hint on the type of insights that can be gotten from the dataset.
Potential Analysis/Questions: In this step, the questions that can be answered with the dataset were identified and it will serve as a bearing when the analysis starts proper.
Potential Insights: I was able too uncover some insights during this step just by observing the data split and it aided in my analysis by narrowing my focus on the important insights that can be gotten from the data set.
Storytelling: After the earlier steps described above, it became easier to tell a story from the dataset by relating the datapoints with each other.

RECOMMENDATION

I recommend that the Government should develop and lead some initiative which will curb the effect of the air pollution in the cities. Some of the recommended initiatives are;

·Promoting Renewable Energy and Clean Transportation:

Incentivizing the use of solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources, as well as promoting electric vehicles and improving public transportation.

·Regulating Industrial Emissions:

Implementing stricter regulations to control emissions from factories and other industrial sources.

·Air Quality Monitoring and Alerts:

Establishing air quality monitoring systems to track pollution levels and provide alerts to the public, allowing them to make informed decisions about their activities.

·Zoning and Land Use Planning:

Strategic zoning can help keep industrial areas away from residential areas, minimizing pollution exposure.

·Promoting Energy Efficiency:

Incentivizing the use of energy-efficient buildings and appliances can reduce the overall carbon footprint and air pollution.

·Supporting Research and Development:

Investing in research and development to find new technologies and strategies for reducing air pollution.

·Public Awareness Campaigns:

Raising public awareness about the health impacts of air pollution and how to reduce it is crucial for individual and collective action

Conclusion

The level of air pollution in the cities is very unhealthy for the inhabitants of the cities as it is expressed by the Air Quality Index levels of the cities therefore the authorities need to strategically lower the pollution levels by enacting and implementing laws to protect the citizens as well as the environment.
